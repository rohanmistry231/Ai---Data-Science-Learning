    "# 🏠 **Project: Smart Home Automation System**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📄 **Project Description**\n",
    "You are tasked with building a basic Smart Home Automation System using Python. The system will monitor and control various home devices based on user input and environmental conditions. The system will include functionalities like temperature control, security check, energy management, and personalized user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 **Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ **Temperature Control:**\n",
    "- The system should monitor the temperature and take actions based on the temperature range:\n",
    "  - **Below 18°C:** Turn on the heater.\n",
    "  - **18°C to 25°C:** No action needed.\n",
    "  - **Above 25°C:** Turn on the air conditioner.\n",
    "  - **Above 35°C:** Raise an alert.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ **Security Check:**\n",
    "- The system should ask if the user has locked all doors before going to bed.\n",
    "- If any door is unlocked, it should remind the user to lock it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ **Energy Management:**\n",
    "- Based on the time of the day:\n",
    "  - **6 AM to 6 PM:** Turn off all unnecessary lights.\n",
    "  - **6 PM to 10 PM:** Keep lights on.\n",
    "  - **After 10 PM:** Dim the lights.\n",
    "- Check if any devices are left on after 10 PM and suggest turning them off to save energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ **User Personalization:**\n",
    "- Ask the user if they want to start their morning routine (e.g., make coffee, play morning playlist) based on the time they wake up.\n",
    "- Provide different suggestions based on user preferences (e.g., if they like a cold or hot morning shower, play soothing music if they prefer it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ **Additional Features:**\n",
    "- The system should ask the user if they want to override any automated settings.\n",
    "- Implement a security feature that asks for a password when attempting to change security settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 **Guidelines**\n",
    "- Use nested if-else statements to manage the control flow of different conditions.\n",
    "- Implement multiple conditional checks within a single block where applicable.\n",
    "- Use functions to modularize different parts of the system.\n",
    "- Ensure that the system handles invalid input gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 **Sample Input/Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature Control:**\n",
    "  - Input: `Current Temperature: 20°C`\n",
    "  - Output: `No action needed.`\n",
    "  - Input: `Current Temperature: 37°C`\n",
    "  - Output: `Turning on the air conditioner. Alert: Temperature is too high!`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Check:**\n",
    "  - Input: `Is the front door locked? (yes/no): no`\n",
    "  - Output: `Please lock the front door before going to bed.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Energy Management:**\n",
    "  - Input: `Current Time: 11 PM`\n",
    "  - Output: `Dim the lights. Turn off unnecessary devices to save energy.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Personalization:**\n",
    "  - Input: `Start morning routine? (yes/no): yes`\n",
    "  - Output: `Making coffee. Playing morning playlist.`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Expected Outcome**\n",
    "By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to use conditional statements in complex scenarios, including handling multiple conditions, user inputs, and error management."
