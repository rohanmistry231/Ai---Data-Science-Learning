# Various important algorithms
## Sorting and Selection
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort (by recursion)
* Quicksort (using additional arrays)
* Quicksort (in-place by partioning and swapping, no additional memory required)
* Selection of n-th order statistic using __randomized pivot algorithm__ (in-place, no additional memory required)
* Selection of n-th order statistic using __randomized pivot algorithm__ using additional arrays (easier implementation)
* Selection of n-th order statistic using __medians of medians technique (no randomization involved)__
